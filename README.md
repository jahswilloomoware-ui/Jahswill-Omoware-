### 1. What is backend development and how is it different from frontend development?
**Backend Development: Refers to the server-side of an application, focusing on databases, servers, APIs, and the logic that powers the frontend. It handles data storage, processing, security, and communication with the frontend. Users don't directly interact with the backend.
** Difference from Frontend Development:
Frontend: Deals with the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) – everything the user sees and interacts with in a web browser or mobile app (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), While Backend: Deals with the "behind-the-scenes" logic, data management, and server operations that make the frontend functional (e.g., databases, APIs, server-side languages like Python, Node.js, Java).
### Mention three backend programming languages.
*Python
*Node.js (JavaScript)
*Java
### What is a server, explain its role backend development.
* Server: A computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients." In web development, a server is typically a powerful computer that stores website files, databases, and applications.
Role in Backend Development: The server hosts the backend application. It receives requests from client applications (e.g., web browsers), processes them using the backend logic, interacts with databases to retrieve or store data, and sends responses back to the client. It's the central hub for data and business logic.
### Define an API and explain its purpose.
* API (Application Programming Interface): can be defined as a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
* Purpose: APIs enable integration and interoperability between systems. They allow developers to access specific functionalities or data from another application without needing to understand its internal implementation. For example, a weather app can use  a weather API to get forecast data, or a social media app can an API to share content.
### What is a database and why is it important in backend systems?
Database: Refers to an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.
      Databases are crucial for backend systems because they provide a persistent storage mechanism for all application data (user profiles, product information, orders, etc.). The backend logic interacts with the database to store new data, retrieve existing data, update records, and delete information, ensuring data integrity and availability.
### List two differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
* SQL (Relational Databases)  Uses a structured, tabular schema with predefined columns and rows, while NOSQL Uses a dynamic schema, often document-based, key-value, graph, or column-family.
Typically SQL scale vertically (more powerful server) eg MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, while NoSQL  Typically scale horizontally (add more servers) eg MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4.
